# Caesar-Cypher
**Instructions Given:**
	
*"For this final assignment, we will explore a new programming language - Python!  Learning about multiple programming languages helps us to reinforce the big computing concepts we've learned throughout the course, and has the added benefit of: (1) preparing for AP CSA, a similar object-oriented language and (2) applying these concepts in a new context"*

**Project Description:**

For this final project, I have created a ceasar cipher {on Discord*} that can encode and decode using a key. The program will output a left-shift version, and a right-shift version of said key :D
